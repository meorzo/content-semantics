    <h2>Memorable quotes about beets</h2>
      <p>Commonly found in a certain business park in Scranton, PA (grown locally at one Schrute Farms), the beet is considered by many to be the mother of all vegetables. <strong>Not to be eaten raw by non-beet farmers.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>"Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. <i>Battlestar Galactica.""</i><cite> - Jim.</cite></blockquote>
      <p>A term Massapequa students use as a practical joke towards one another. Inducing online trauma and remorse. The shame of being "BEETS" 'd promotes social dismay and depression.</p>
      <p><q> - Yo man, I left my facebook up for one second and I got <em>"BEETS"</em><cite> - Sir Sweeps.</cite></p>
      <p>- Well I'll be a monkey's uncle.<cite> - Bass.''</cite></q></p>
    <h3>Terms and definitions<h3>
    <dl>
     <dt>Root</dt>
      <p><dd>The root is what we traditionally think of as beet. To prevent them from bleeding their purple color, leave <data>2 inches</data> of stem when you cut them from the greens. <b>Beets</b> are dense and take a long time to cook. By using beets smaller than <data>2 inches</data> and cutting them in quarters before boiling or roasting, you can greatly reduce the cooking time.</dd></p>
    <dt>Leaves</dt>
     <p><dd>Beet leaves are often discarded, but they are completely edible. Only baby beets tend to have small, tender leaves suitable for salads. The greens that usually accompany beets are more suitable to cooking. After a thorough cleaning, they can be steamed or saut√©ed, much like Swiss char.</dd></p>
